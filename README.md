 Support ticket app

This is a simple single page application to keep track of support tickets from users. 

This app is split up into frontend and backend folders. 

The backend contains the functionality to send queries to a local mySql database using Node.js and Express. All requests go to the same URL but use different HTTP methods. 

The frontend is a UI to work with the current database entries. The ticket issue can be viewed in a pop out modal. Each issue can be edited/closed with the changes be updated on the database. 

Here is a short video demonstrating the functionality:
